Gamma extends work done on a prototype to implement a reliable, scalable, and performant platform on which to develop curatorial, archival, and publishing applications. The focus of Gamma will be on developing a Blacklight- and Hydra head-based web application for basic ingest, curation, search, and display of digital assets atop a publishing & curation platform. Ingest and curation services will be piloted by select University stakeholders during the project; search and display functions will be available as a new beta service to the University community and the general public. 

Baseline Application Features

 * Upload files to archival storage 
 * Describe an object with metadata
 * Assign controls to authorize access by classes of users
