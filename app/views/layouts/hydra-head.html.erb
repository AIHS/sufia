This file should only be triggered if your controller doesn't declare its layout.
In most cases you will want to explicitly declare the layout in the controller. 
Sufia provides three default layouts: 

* sufia-one-column: does not include a sidebar
* sufia-two-column: this includes a sidebar for facets
* homepage: three-column homepage with 

@example:
  class MyController < ApplicationController  
     layout "sufia-one-column"
     ... etc ...
  end
%>
<% if params[:controller].eql?("catalog") and !has_search_parameters? %> 
  <%= render file: "layouts/homepage"%>
<% else %>
  <%= render file: "layouts/sufia-two-column"%>
<% end %>
