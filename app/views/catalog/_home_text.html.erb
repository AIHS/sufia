      <p>ScholarSphere helps Penn State researchers share their work with a worldwide
audience. Faculty, students, and academic programs can use ScholarSphere to collect 
their work in one location to create a durable and citeable record of their papers, 
presentations, publications, datasets or other scholarly creations.  Penn State offers 
this service to its community to comply with funder policies for sharing the results of 
research.  ScholarSphere helps fulfill the University's land grant mission to share its
knowledge with the citizens of Pennsylvania and beyond.
